  features:
    ☐ CAN
      ✘ transmit, console @cancelled (22-06-01 09:33)
      ☐ receive interrupt
      ☐ filtering
    ☐ PWM output
    ☐ ADC
    ☐ timer
    ☐ protothreads

  investigations:
   ☐ scrub compiler `-WmsgSd` args to see if any can be pragma'ed instead, since making them the default may not be desirable
   ☐ scrub linker `-WmsgSd` args to see if segment / object overlap is still a problem.
   ☐ verify whether `mc9s08dz60.c` is required.
