  investigations:
   ✔ scrub compiler `-WmsgSd` args to see if any can be pragma'ed instead, since making them the default may not be desirable @done (22-06-01 09:46)
   ✔ scrub linker `-WmsgSd` args to see if segment / object overlap is still a problem - no @done (22-06-01 09:40)
   ✔ verify whether `mc9s08dz60.c` is required - yes @done (22-06-01 09:38)
